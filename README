# Intro

DLauncher is a modified dmenu that provide flexible launcher
functions, including but not limited to:

 - Dynamic content
 - Plugin
 - History
 - Persistent daemon (wake up by signal)

# Plugins

 - cmd: open executable in $PATH
 - ssh: open ssh terminal to host alias
 - dir: open terminal in a given directory
 - shell: run input in a shell 
 - zsh: complete line using zsh engine (check dot_dlauncher_example to see how to activate this)

FYI: zsh plugin does not work on FreeBSD due to a bug on ``zpty''

# TODO

 - timed updating mechanism
 - more plugins
   - calculator plugin
   - url plugin

Feel free to hack it.

# Keybindings

Most of keybindings are the same as in dmenu, excepting some new:

 Mod1 + Tab: switch between available plugins
 Mod1 + a: same as Up
 Mod1 + d: same as Down
 Mod1 + w, Mod1 + Up: prev history
 Mod1 + s, Mod1 + Down: next history
 Mod1 + r: same as Return. This allows one-hand operating
 
It's easy to change them in the source code.

# Build & Install

DLauncher uses CMake to compile the project.
Makefile provides shortcuts for compiling/installing.

# Usage

dot_dlauncher_example is a sample dlauncher configuration file (~/.dlauncher)

dlauncher start - start the dlauncher deamon
dlauncher exit  - kill the dlauncher deamon
